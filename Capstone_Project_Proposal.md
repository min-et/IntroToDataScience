Final Capstone Project Proposal
===============================

What is the problem you want to solve?
--------------------------------------

Identify the acculturation level of Hispanics by using a different set
of variables that can be gathered without the need of running an online
survey.

Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldnâ€™t have otherwise?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My client would be Market Research and Advertising companies. It would
give them the flexibility to target the different levels of
acculturation before running an recruitment or Ad campaign and therefore
save money with a better audience.

What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are 2 main data sets that I think will helpful and that are
available for free:

    [Pew Research data sets](http://www.pewhispanic.org/datasets/>)
    [Census data sets](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets.html)

In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or a slide deck.
