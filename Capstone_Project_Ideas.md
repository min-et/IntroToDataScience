# Intro to Data Science - Capstone Project Ideas

## Idea #1 - Acculturation level

Market research companies have similar Hispanic and multicultural acculturation levels in online surveys where respondents are classified as high, medium or low acculturated based on a set of 4-5 questions (You can find it at the end of this document). As time passes, itâ€™s harder for this type of companies to ask for information via surveys and more methods (i.e. Behavioral data and cookies) for capturing data keep coming and are tested in order to supply the lack of data in certain areas. 
My goal would be to predict and assign this acculturation levels based on another variables as zip codes, education, household income, and other variables that we can get without from another data sets.

## Idea #2 - Hispanic Generation

This idea would be pretty similar as idea #1, the difference would be that I can use more variables or a different set of variables to identify the generation and not be limited to the acculturation variables needed on idea #1.

## Idea #3 - US Permanent Visa 

This is an interesting dataset from a person like me that went through this process. The goal here would be to predict the visa decisions based on the different variables on this dataset.
